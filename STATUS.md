# STATUS — living state of the Tier-2 effort

> Agents: update this file every session. Newest session notes on top.
> Format discipline: keep "Now" brutally short; details go to Field notes / History.

## Now

- **Current milestone:** M1 — Capture engine (M0 complete, G0 passed; M1-T1 done)
- **Next task:** M1-T2 (`CaptureEngine` actor: SCStreamConfiguration from
  CaptureConfiguration, start/stop, `EngineEvent` AsyncStream per docs/01,
  `engine-smoke` CLI subcommand — see M1-T2 checklist). NOTE: watch the M0-T5 field note
  — CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess returned false for the CLI binary; engine-smoke will
  reveal whether capture works from the terminal or needs its own grant.
- **Blockers:** none

## Needs Franco (human-only items)

- [x] M0-T2 prerequisite DONE (2026-07-14): self-signed Code Signing identity
      "screenrec-dev" created in login keychain and trusted for codeSign policy
      (`security add-trusted-cert -r trustRoot -p codeSign`). Verified: signs and
      passes `codesign --verify --strict`. devsign.sh should find and use this
      identity; it must NOT try to create a new one.
- [ ] First GUI TCC grants for the .app once M4 begins (grant + relaunch dance).
- (gates marked "(human)" in docs/04 accumulate here as milestones close)

## Field notes (append; things learned that docs don't cover yet)

- 2026-07-14 (M0 holistic review + M1-T1): Holistic M0 review passed from a fully clean
  state (`rm -rf .build dist` → build/test(23)/release/bundle all green; devsign
  idempotent; designated requirement stable across fresh rebuilds; CLI works). M0 is
  genuinely complete. M1-T1: CaptureConfiguration + QualityPreset/DisplaySelection/
  MicrophoneSelection value types + pixel math, 29 tests. CLI now parses presets via
  QualityPreset (placeholder array removed).
- 2026-07-14 (M0-T5): CLI dry-run + list-mics work. TWO things to watch in M1:
  (1) `CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess()` returns false ("not determined") for the
  freshly-built Tier-2 CLI even though this terminal records fine via the Tier-1 PoC —
  TCC screen-recording grants attach to the responsible binary's code identity, so the
  new binary may need its own grant, or preflight is just conservative. M1-T2's
  engine-smoke will settle whether capture actually works from the terminal or needs a
  grant. (2) Desktop preflight now reports OK because this terminal currently CAN write
  there (the write-probe tests reality) — so the old "Desktop always fails" is
  environment-specific, not universal; ~/Movies default still stands as the no-grant-
  needed choice.
- 2026-07-14 (M0-T4): Permissions.swift + OutputLocation.swift in RecorderCore, 23
  tests green. Ran /code-review (xhigh workflow) on the diff; fixed 5 of 6 findings:
  preflight now probes WRITE access (opendir only proved read/execute) and distinguishes
  a missing folder from a permission denial; mic resolution rejects a stale/unplugged
  preferred ID and an empty default; timestamp/resolvedFileName made internal.
  **Deferred to M2 (open item):** newRecordingURL collision resolution is check-then-act
  (TOCTOU) — two recordings started in the same clock second could resolve to the same
  name. Real fix = the writer creating the file with `O_EXCL` and retrying the suffix on
  EEXIST. Low risk now (manual recording is single-instance; replay uses a "Replay"
  prefix). MovieRecorder (M2-T2/T4) MUST use exclusive create — add to that task's work.
- 2026-07-14 (M0-T3): bundle.sh assembles/signs dist/ScreenRec.app. Verified:
  Identifier=dev.fcostantini.screenrec.app, Authority=screenrec-dev; designated
  requirement byte-identical across two rebuilds (`identifier "…" and certificate leaf
  = H"62a8ac…"`) → TCC grants will survive rebuilds; `open` launches the LSUIElement
  app, process stays alive, quits cleanly. `spctl -a -t exec` fails (not notarized) —
  expected pre-M6, script reports it without failing. Info.plist lives at
  Sources/ScreenRecApp/Resources/Info.plist and is `exclude`d in Package.swift so SPM
  ignores it.
- 2026-07-14 (M0-T1): Command Line Tools have NO XCTest — `import XCTest` fails to
  compile. Swift Testing (`import Testing`) works and is now the mandated framework
  (docs/02 §10 updated). Verify evidence: `swift build` links all 3 targets;
  `swift test` → "1 test passed"; CLI prints skeleton banner with RecorderCore 0.1.0.

- 2026-07-13 (planning session): Tier-1 PoC (~/code/screenrec-poc) empirically verified:
  SCRecordingOutput survives kill -9 with sub-second loss; nil microphoneCaptureDeviceID
  throws "invalid parameter" on 15.6; Desktop output dir fails the same way when the
  terminal lacks the Files & Folders grant; recordedDuration is NaN pre-first-frame.
  All encoded in docs/02.

## History

- 2026-07-14 — docs/06-ui-spec.md added (menu states, notification copy, onboarding,
  contractual UserDefaults keys). Independent-agent audit of all milestones/tasks run;
  fixes applied across docs/01–06 (EngineEvent surface defined in 01, replay-save
  trigger = SIGUSR1/stdin on replay-arm, record subcommand lifecycle reconciled, probe
  extensions assigned to M2-T4, unrunnable Verify steps fixed or marked human). See
  git log for the diff.

- 2026-07-13 — Research + Tier-1 PoC completed in ~/code/screenrec-poc. Tier-2 planning
  docs authored (docs/00–05, CLAUDE.md, this file). No Tier-2 code exists yet.
